# Jaroszynski_CSCI2270_FinalProject

## Project Summary
The library is a contact book. It uses hash tables to speed up searching. It keeps a separate hash table for each search parameter. Because of the high number of contacts that may have the same parameter, it keeps an array of all the contacts that match. It can save its data to a .csv file and load from one as well.
